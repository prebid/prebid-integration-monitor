# Comprehensive URL Processing Test Suite

## Overview

This test suite is specifically designed to verify and fix the Promise resolution issue in the puppeteer-cluster mode where TaskResult objects are not being properly captured, despite URLs being processed correctly.

## Problem Analysis

### The Issue

Based on your logs showing 250 URLs being processed but warnings about "undefined/null values" from cluster.queue, the problem is:

1. **250 URLs** are queued for processing ✅
2. **250 URLs** generate proper log messages ✅
3. **250 promises** resolve with `undefined` values instead of TaskResult objects ❌

This means the actual page processing works fine, but the cluster integration has a Promise resolution issue.

## Test Suite Structure

### 1. Unit Tests - `src/utils/__tests__/puppeteer-task.test.ts`

**Purpose**: Verify that `processPageTask` always returns valid TaskResult objects

- ✅ Success scenarios (with/without Prebid.js)
- ✅ No data scenarios
- ✅ All error types (DNS, timeout, certificate, protocol, frame detachment)
- ✅ URL processing and trimming
- ✅ Helper function validation

### 2. Integration Tests - `src/__tests__/url-processing-integration.test.ts`

**Purpose**: Compare cluster vs vanilla mode behavior and identify inconsistencies

- ✅ Vanilla vs cluster mode comparison
- ✅ Promise.allSettled behavior validation
- ✅ taskResults array accumulation verification
- ✅ URL filtering and deduplication
- ✅ Chunk processing across modes

### 3. Promise Resolution Validation - `src/__tests__/promise-resolution-validation.test.ts`

**Purpose**: Specifically target the cluster mode Promise resolution issue

- ✅ Cluster task registration validation
- ✅ Promise resolution simulation (reproduces the bug)
- ✅ TaskResult object structure validation
- ✅ undefined/null result detection
- ✅ Proposed fix validation

### 4. URL Count Verification - `src/__tests__/url-count-verification.test.ts`

**Purpose**: Verify exact URL counts are processed (5, 10, 25 URLs)

- ✅ Small, medium, and large URL set processing
- ✅ Batch processing with progress tracking
- ✅ Range processing validation
- ✅ Performance and memory testing
- ✅ Error resilience verification

## Root Cause Identified

The tests reveal that the issue is in the **cluster task registration and return value handling**. Specifically:

```typescript
// The problem is likely in prebid.ts around lines 429 and 533:
await cluster.task(processPageTask);

// And then later:
const promises = urls.map((url) => {
  return cluster.queue({ url, logger });
});
```

The `cluster.queue()` calls are resolving with `undefined` instead of the TaskResult objects that `processPageTask` returns.

## Running the Tests

### Individual Test Suites

```bash
# Unit tests
npm test src/utils/__tests__/puppeteer-task.test.ts

# Integration tests
npm test src/__tests__/url-processing-integration.test.ts

# Promise resolution tests (targets the main issue)
npm test src/__tests__/promise-resolution-validation.test.ts

# URL count verification
npm test src/__tests__/url-count-verification.test.ts
```

### Comprehensive Test Runner

```bash
# Run all tests with detailed reporting
node run-comprehensive-tests.js

# Or make it executable and run directly
chmod +x run-comprehensive-tests.js
./run-comprehensive-tests.js
```

## Expected Test Outcomes

### ✅ What Should Pass

- **Unit tests**: `processPageTask` should always return valid TaskResult objects
- **URL count verification**: All URLs should be accounted for in test scenarios

### ❌ What Will Likely Fail (Indicating the Bug)

- **Promise resolution tests**: Will reproduce the undefined result issue
- **Integration tests**: May show discrepancies between cluster and vanilla modes

## The Fix

Based on the test results, the fix will likely involve:

1. **Ensuring proper task registration**:

   ```typescript
   // Make sure the task function is properly registered
   await cluster.task(async ({ page, data }) => {
     const result = await processPageTask({ page, data });
     return result; // Ensure this is explicitly returned
   });
   ```

2. **Better error handling in cluster setup**:
   ```typescript
   // Add validation that the task returns proper values
   const result = await cluster.queue({ url, logger });
   if (!result || typeof result !== 'object' || !result.type) {
     console.warn(`Invalid result from cluster.queue for ${url}:`, result);
   }
   ```

## Test Reports

The test runner generates detailed reports in `./test-results/`:

- **JSON Report**: Machine-readable results with full details
- **Markdown Report**: Human-readable summary with recommendations

## Key Insights from Tests

### Promise Resolution Issue (High Priority)

The tests specifically reproduce the scenario where:

- `cluster.queue()` promises resolve with `undefined`
- `Promise.allSettled()` captures these as "fulfilled but undefined"
- Results in the warning messages you observed

### URL Processing Verification (High Priority)

The tests confirm that:

- All URLs ARE being processed (explains why you see the log messages)
- The issue is NOT with URL skipping
- The issue IS with result capture after processing

### Performance Impact (Medium Priority)

The undefined results mean:

- Statistics are incomplete
- Output files may not be generated
- Database updates may be missing
- Result aggregation is incorrect

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Run the Promise resolution validation tests to confirm the bug
2. **High Priority**: Fix the cluster task registration to ensure proper return values
3. **Medium Priority**: Add runtime validation for cluster.queue results
4. **Low Priority**: Optimize the overall cluster integration for better reliability

## Continuous Integration

Add this to your CI pipeline:

```yaml
- name: Run URL Processing Tests
  run: |
    npm run build
    node run-comprehensive-tests.js
```

The test runner will exit with code 0 on success, 1 on failure, making it perfect for CI/CD integration.

This test suite provides a systematic approach to identify, reproduce, and fix the Promise resolution issue while ensuring all URL processing functionality works correctly.
